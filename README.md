Python scripts to assist in workflow processes

The point of this script is to simplify the USGS streamflow records process by enabling a series of dialog prompts to plug and play into a textfile. 
After inputting all user-defined variables, the workflow should automatically place the variables into correct listings and then output a textfile containing the raw station analysis per USGS guidelines.
The script is written in rudimentary Python terms, and is a work in progress. Version 1.0.0 is expected to eventually reach a point where most variables will be pulled from the USGS National Water Information System.
